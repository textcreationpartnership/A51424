from the Principles of the Romiſh
Schooles.

That the firſt Expoſition of Romiſh Doctors, of great learning, (referring
the word [THIS] properly to Chriſt his Body)
perverteth the ſenſe of Chriſt his Speech; by the
Confeſsions of Romiſh Doctors.
SECT. II.

That the ſecond Romiſh Expoſition, referring the Pronoune [THIS]

ſame with this word, SIGNIFIETH.

[THIS IS MY BODY] opened unto us by a Third
Key, in the Pronoune [MEVM] as it is pronounced
by the Romiſh Prieſt, in his Conſecration; 
a Point as obſervable
as any other.

 them Inſufficient.
The firſt is, that the Prieſt pronounceth Chriſts words

the other Diſciples, confirmed (in the ſecond place)

      * CHAP. IV.

Or, an Antidote to expell all their poyſonſome Pretences
in that behalfe.

of men of our owne Proteſtant
 Profeſsion, concerning the Iudgment

Fathers, contrary to their owne Romiſh
Principles.
SECT. X.

    _ THE
FOVRTH BOOKE,
Treating of the ſecond Romiſh Conſequence, ariſing from
the falſe Expoſition of theſe words of Chriſt, [THIS 
IS MY BODY,] called Corporall Preſence
in the Sacrament of
the Euchariſt.

      * CHAP. I.

That notwithſtanding the difference of opinion of Chriſt's Preſence
be onely De modo, that is, of the maner of Being; yet
may the Romiſh Doctrine be Hereticall: and
to hold the contrary is a pernitious
Paradoxe.

in this Sacrament; yet hold they a true Preſence thereof
in divers Reſpects; according to the Iudgement
of Antiquitie.

vilifie the Sacrament of the Euchariſt, as it is celebrated

The Romiſh profeſſed maner of Preſence of Chriſts
Body in this Sacrament.

Illuſions, is Vnſufficient.

their Complices:
SECT. V.

 ⚜ A Digreſsion upon occaſion of a late Diſcourſe of a greatly

Obſervables.
SECT VI.

II. The ſame Authors Diſcourſe upon the Romiſh Stories, concerning
the mentioned Reliques of Chriſts Blood, iſſued
 out Miraculouſly from Images.
SECT. VII.

      * CHAP. III.

of Chriſt, in the Sacrament, is manifoldly
Impoſſible.
SECT. I.

I. That, by the Iudgement of ancient Fathers, ſome things (by reaſon
of Contradiction in them) may be called Impoſſible, without
the impeachment of the Omnipotency of God;
yea, with the great advancement
thereof.
SECT. II.

II. That the Do•trine of the ſame Impoſſibiity (by reaſon of
Contradiction) doth magnifie the Power of God, by the
Univerſall conſent of Romiſh Doctors; and their
divers Examples of Impoſſibility, concerning
a Body.
SECT. III.

III. That the Doctrine of Calvin (who is moſt traduced in this
point) accordeth to the former Iudgement of
ancient Fathers.

      * CHAP. IV.

The firſt Romiſh Contradiction, in making it Borne 
and not borne of a Virgin.
SECT. I.

      * CHAP. V.

The ſecond Romiſh Contradiction, to the overthrowing of
that which Chriſt called [MY BODIE:] by
making one Body of Chriſt, not One,
but Many.
SECT. I.

That the ſame Second Romiſh Contradiction, holding the Preſence
 of one Body in many places at once, is proved,
by the nature of Being in diſtinct places at one
time, to be a making One, not One.
SECT. II.

The ſame Second Romiſh Contradiction manifeſted in Scripture,
 by an Argument Angelicall.
SECT. III.

That the Romiſh Objection out of that Scripture,
Act. 9. is frivolous.
 SECT. IV.

 That the Opinion of the Being of a Body, in many places at once,
implyeth a Contradiction, is Secondly proved by the Iudgement
of Ancient Fathers, thereby diſtinguiſhing Chriſt his two
Natures, Godhead and Manhood, one from
another, by Circumſcription and
Incircumſcription.
SECT. V.

That the Romiſh Doctors (in their Objections) have no ſolid
proofe of the Exiſtence of one Body in divers places
 at once: from the Iuagement of
Antiquitie.
SECT. VI.

 That your moſt plauſible Objection, taken out of Auguſtine, concerning
Chriſt his Carrying himſelfe in his owne
hands, is but Sophiſticall.
SECT▪ VII.

 That (thirdly) the Contradiction, and conſequently the Impoſſibility
of the Being of one Body in divers Places at
once, is evicted by two ſound Reaſons;
the firſt taken from Contradictory
Relations.
SECT. VIII.

 That (fourthly) a Contradiction, and conſequently an Impoſſibility
of the Being of a Body in two places at once,
is proved by abſolute Qualities and Actions,
which are voyd of Relation
to Place.
SECT. IX.

      * CHAP. VI.

A Confutation of the firſt Romiſh Reaſon, obtruded for
proofe of a Poſsibilitie of Exiſtence or a Body
in divers places at once, taken from
the nature either of a Voyce,
or Colour.
SECT. I.

A Confutation of their ſecond, and third Reaſons, taken from the
Similitude of mans Soule, or Preſence of God, deviſed to 
demonſtrate a No-Contradiction of a Bodies Being

A Confutation of the former two Romiſh Inſtances in Mans
Soule, and God himſelfe, by Ancient Fathers, in their

 Mens Spirits.

A Confutation of the Third Romiſh Pretence, why they need
not yeeld to theſe Reaſons whereby their Doctrine is proved
to be ſo groſſely Vnreaſonable.
 SECT. IV.

      * CHAP. VII.

The third Romiſh Contradiction, againſt the words of
Chriſt [MY BODIE,] is by making a Body
Finite, to be a Body not finite.
SECT. I.

That, by the Iudgement of Ancient Fathers, the Being in divers
places at once inferreth an Infiniteneſſe Proper unto
God: which without Hereſie cannot be aſcribed to
any humane Body; Proved from the maner

Ghoſt.

Preſence of a Body of Chriſt, with all the parts
thereof in the leaſt Indiviſible point 
of the Hoaſt.

to the nature of an Organicall and Humane Body, in the
Iudgement of Romiſh Doctors of later times.
SECT. IV.

to the Dimenſion of the places, wherein they
are; is proved by the confeſſed Romiſh Principle
it ſelfe.

 of ancient Fathers.

That the Romiſh Objections, againſt our former Tenet,
taken from Miraculous Penetrations,

Being of the whole Body of Chriſt in
every part of the Hoaſt

Of the fift Romiſh Contradiction againſt the words of
Chriſt [MY BODY] as the ſame Body is now conſidered
to be moſt perfect, by making it

Chriſt, now glorified, to be destitute of naturall and voluntary

 ancient Patronage either of written or of unwritten
Tradition; but against Both.
SECT. III.

the Majeſticall Body of Chriſt.
